# Introduction

## Key Features

- **Smart Configuration Loading**: Automatically finds and loads configuration files from multiple possible locations and formats
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with automatic type generation for your config files
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built to be lightweight and fast, perfect for Bun projects
- **Flexible Format Support**: Supports `.ts`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, and `.json` configuration files
- **Deep Merging**: Intelligently merges default configurations with file-based configs
- **Multiple Search Patterns**: Supports various config file naming conventions
- **Type Generation**: Automatically generates TypeScript types for your config files

## Why bunfig?

When building Bun applications, you often need a way to manage configuration that is:

- Type-safe
- Easy to use
- Flexible enough to support different environments
- Fast and lightweight

bunfig solves these problems by providing a zero-dependency configuration loader that works seamlessly with Bun and TypeScript. Think of it as `unconfig`, but optimized specifically for Bun projects.

### Key Benefits

1. **Simple API**: Load your configuration with a single function call
2. **Type Safety**: Get full TypeScript support and automatic type generation
3. **Zero Dependencies**: Keep your project lean and fast
4. **Flexible**: Support multiple config file formats and locations
5. **Bun-Optimized**: Built specifically for the Bun runtime

## Quick Example

```ts
import { config } from 'bunfig'

interface AppConfig {
  port: number
  database: {
    url: string
    pool: number
  }
}

const cfg = await config<AppConfig>({
  name: 'my-app',
  defaultConfig: {
    port: 3000,
    database: {
      url: 'localhost',
      pool: 5,
    },
  },
})
```

## Testing
